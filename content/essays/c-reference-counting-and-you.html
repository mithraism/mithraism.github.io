<p>Manual memory management using <code>malloc()</code> and <code>free()</code> works nicely, but can become tiresome. If you forget a call to <code>free()</code>, you leak memory; if you free memory too much you crash.</p>

<p>One technique which can make memory management a lot easier is <em>reference counting</em>, which this article is about. I'll explain what it is, how it works, and why it is useful.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> for clarity, this code in this tutorial does not contain a lot of error handling. In real-world applications, you definitely need to perform some error checking.</p>

<div class="section" id="a-simple-dynamic-array">
	<h2>A Simple Dynamic Array</h2>

	<p>For this example, I've written a very simple dynamic array. (A dynamic array automatically expands when adding new elements, unlike a normal C array.) Here's the interface:</p>

	<pre><code class="c"><span class="comment">/* array type */</span>
<span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="storage">struct array_s</span> <span class="storage">array_t</span>;

<span class="comment">/* creates an array */</span>
<span class="storage">array_t *</span><span class="function">array_create</span>(<span class="storage">void</span>);

<span class="comment">/* deallocates an array */</span>
<span class="storage">void</span> <span class="function">array_destroy</span>(<span class="storage">array_t *</span><span class="variable">a_array</span>);

<span class="comment">/* adds a pointer to the array */</span>
<span class="storage">void</span> <span class="function">array_add</span>(<span class="storage">array_t *</span><span class="variable">a_array</span>, <span class="storage">void *</span><span class="variable">a_data</span>);

<span class="comment">/* gets the pointer at the given index */</span>
<span class="storage">void *</span><span class="function">array_get</span>(<span class="storage">array_t *</span><span class="variable">a_array</span>, <span class="storage">unsigned</span> <span class="variable">a_index</span>);

<span class="comment">/* removes the pointer at the given index */</span>
<span class="storage">void</span> <span class="function">array_remove</span>(<span class="storage">array_t *</span><span class="variable">a_array</span>, <span class="storage">unsigned</span> <span class="variable">a_index</span>);</code></pre>

	<p>For flexibility reasons, this array only holds pointers in its internal storage. It doesn't do anything with them, though &mdash; it doesn't allocate memory for the elements we add to it, and obviously it doesn't free any memory either.</p>
	<p>Because of this, adding an element will require us to allocate memory for it manually, before adding it. Similarly, we'll need to free its memory manually after we're done with it. (You could also simply store pointers without allocating them first in this dynamic array, but then there's the risk of dangling pointers in case you free the memory for the array element elsewhere&hellip;)</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="some-memory-management-ideas">
	<h2>Some Memory Management Ideas</h2>

	<p>There's a few things you can do in order to make memory management easier. Here's a few ideas that don't work:</p>

	<p><strong>First idea:</strong> let <code>array_remove()</code> free the pointer. Using this technique, you'd only have to allocate memory; freeing memory would happen automatically.</p>

	<p>However, a pointer contained in more than one array cannot easily be removed; removing it from one array will render the pointer invalid, and you'd end up with a dangling pointer. Even worse, trying to remove the pointer from a second array will probably cause a crash, because non-allocated memory is being freed.</p>

	<p><strong>Second idea:</strong> let <code>array_add()</code> make a copy of the element that is being added, and add that copy instead. <code>array_add()</code> would need to have a third argument representing the element's size; the function needs to know how many bytes to allocate for it after all. <code>array_remove()</code> would then  free the copy of the element.</p>

	<p>This approach also has some drawbacks. Making a copy of an element takes time, and uses a lot of memory. Updating a single element is not easy; you'd have to search all copies of this element and update those. Lastly, comparing elements isn't as simple as comparing pointers anymore &mdash; you'd need a comparator function to compare two copies.</p>

	<p>The third idea is called <em>reference counting</em>, and it works quite well.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="reference-counting-at-last">
	<h2>Reference Counting, At Last</h2>

	<p>The basic idea behind reference counting is this: every object is given a <em>reference count</em>, which indicates the number of "things" using this object. For example, a "user" object which is in two arrays while being processed in some function would have reference count 3 (3 things: 2 arrays, 1 function).</p>

	<p>When a "thing" starts using a reference-counted object, it increments the object's reference count; this is called <em>retaining</em>. When this "thing" is done using this reference-counted object, it decrements the object's reference count; this is called <em>releasing</em>.</p>

	<p>As long as this object's reference count is higher than zero, some "things" are using it. When it reaches zero, nothing is using the object anymore, and it can safely be deallocated.</p>

	<p>When a reference-counted object is created, its reference count is set to 1; the idea is that the function creating the object is going to use this object.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="objects">
	<h2>Objects</h2>

	<p>The easiest way to add reference counting to existing code is to add a <code>reference_count</code> variable to your <code>struct</code>s. For example, this is a user struct which has a new reference count field:</p>

	<pre><code class="c"><span class="keyword">struct</span> <span class="storage">user_s</span> {
    <span class="storage">char     *</span><span class="variable">first_name</span>;
    <span class="storage">char     *</span><span class="variable">last_name</span>;

    <span class="comment">/* ... */</span>

    <span class="storage">unsigned</span>  <span class="variable">reference_count</span>;
}</code></pre>

	<p>However, this is not a flexible solution. You'd need to update all object types to allow reference counting. You'd probably need to write retain and release functions for every object type in your application.</p>

	<p>A nicer solution is introducing a new object structure, which will wrap around existing objects. This new <code>objwrapper_t</code> type will require only one retain and release function, and it's much nicer to work with in arrays as well. Here's the interface:</p>

	<pre><code class="c"><span class="comment">/* object wrapper type */</span>
<span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="storage">struct objwrapper_s</span> <span class="storage">objwrapper_t</span>;

<span class="comment">/* object wrapper destructor type */</span>
<span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="storage">void</span> (*<span class="function">objwrapper_destructor_t</span>)(<span class="storage">void *</span><span class="variable">a_data</span>);

<span class="comment">/* creates an object wrapper */</span>
<span class="storage">objwrapper_t *</span><span class="function">objwrapper_create</span>(
    <span class="storage">void *</span><span class="variable">a_data</span>,
    <span class="storage">objwrapper_destructor_t</span> <span class="variable">a_destructor</span>
);

<span class="comment">/* returns the object in the object wrapper */</span>
<span class="storage">void *</span><span class="function">objwrapper_get_object</span>(<span class="storage">objwrapper_t *</span><span class="variable">a_objwrapper</span>);

<span class="comment">/* retains the object inside a wrapper */</span>
<span class="storage">void</span> <span class="function">objwrapper_retain</span>(<span class="storage">objwrapper_t *</span><span class="variable">a_objwrapper</span>);

<span class="comment">/* releases the object inside a wrapper */</span>
<span class="storage">void</span> <span class="function">objwrapper_release</span>(<span class="storage">objwrapper_t *</span><span class="variable">a_objwrapper</span>);</code></pre>

	<p>The <code>struct objwrapper_s</code> contains a pointer to the actual object, as well as the destructor and, obviously, the reference count:</p>

	<pre><code class="c"><span class="keyword">struct</span> <span class="storage">objwrapper_s</span> {
    <span class="storage">void                    *</span><span class="variable">data</span>;
    <span class="storage">unsigned</span>                <span class="variable">reference_count</span>;
    <span class="storage">objwrapper_destructor_t</span> <span class="variable">destructor</span>;
};</code></pre>

	<p>Without the object wrapper, you'd create an object and pass the pointer to this object around to other functions, add it to arrays, etc. With the object wrapper, you'd create an object and an object wrapper, and pass the object wrapper around instead.</p>

	<p>Here's what these functions do, under the hood:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><code>objwrapper_create()</code> creates a new wrapper with reference count 1.</li>
		<li><code>objwrapper_get_object()</code> returns the wrapper's object.</li>
		<li><code>objwrapper_retain()</code> increments the reference count.</li>
		<li><code>objwrapper_release()</code> decrements the reference count, and deallocates the object (using the destructor function) and its wrapper if it's zero.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>With this object wrapper implementation in place, let's take a look at adding reference counting to the array implementation from the beginning of the article.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="a-dynamic-reference-counting-array">
	<h2>A Dynamic Reference-Counting Array</h2>

	<p>The array implementation won't change too much. Most importantly, arrays will keep a collection of <em>object wrappers</em>, not pointers, in memory; the interface will need to be changed to reflect this. Here's the new one:</p>

	<pre><code class="c"><span class="comment">/* array type */</span>
<span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="storage">struct array_s</span> <span class="storage">array_t</span>;

<span class="comment">/* creates an array */</span>
<span class="storage">array_t *</span><span class="function">array_create</span>(<span class="storage">void</span>);

<span class="comment">/* deallocates an array */</span>
<span class="storage">void</span> <span class="function">array_destroy</span>(<span class="storage">array_t *</span><span class="variable">a_array</span>);

<span class="comment">/* adds an object wrapper to the array */</span>
<span class="storage">void</span> <span class="function">array_add</span>(<span class="storage">array_t *</span><span class="variable">a_array</span>, <span class="storage">objwrapper_t *</span><span class="variable">a_objwrapper</span>);

<span class="comment">/* gets the object wrapper at the given index */</span>
<span class="storage">objwrapper_t *</span><span class="function">array_get</span>(<span class="storage">array_t *</span><span class="variable">a_array</span>, <span class="storage">unsigned</span> <span class="variable">a_index</span>);

<span class="comment">/* removes the object wrapper at the given index */</span>
<span class="storage">void</span> <span class="function">array_remove</span>(<span class="storage">array_t *</span><span class="variable">a_array</span>, <span class="storage">unsigned</span> <span class="variable">a_index</span>);</code></pre>

	<p>Here's what these functions do to the object wrappers, under the hood:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><code>array_create()</code> creates an empty list of object wrappers.</li>
		<li><code>array_destroy()</code> releases all object wrappers.</li>
		<li><code>array_add()</code> adds the given object wrapper to the list and retains it.</li>
		<li><code>array_get()</code> returns the object wrapper at the given index.</li>
		<li><code>array_remove()</code> removes object wrapper at the given index and releases it.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Because of reference counting, <code>array_destroy()</code> and <code>array_remove()</code> don't deallocate anything. They just release the object using the <code>objwrapper_release</code> function &mdash; which will deallocate the object and its wrapper if its retain count reaches zero.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="the-implementation">
	<h2>The Implementation</h2>

	<p>As you may have noticed, I haven't actually <em>implemented</em> anything of the above; there's only some <code>typedef</code>s, <code>struct</code>s and function declarations. This is mostly because I think that the <em>interface</em> is much more important than the implementation &mdash; the latter is simply filling in the blanks, which is (more or less) easy.</p>

	<p>Still, I've written the implementation and put it into a sample project, which you can <a href="/pub/software/c_reference_counting_and_you.tar.gz" title="Download the sample C reference counting project">download here</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="a-look-ahead">
	<h2>A Look Ahead</h2>

	<p>This post only scratches the surface of reference counting. I've deliberately kept this article entry-level; I'm probably not qualified to dig much deeper into algorithms and optimizations and related techniques.</p>

	<p>There is one more advanced topic worth mentioning, though, and that's the problem of <em>retain cycles</em>, which occur when two objects retain each other. Imagine this situation: a "user" object has a retained reference to an "e-mail address" object, and an "e-mail address" object has a retained reference to a "user" object. Both objects retain each other &mdash; the result is a memory leak, because neither object will ever be de-allocated.</p>

	<p>Reference counting can make memory management much easier, but only when done right. If even reference counting is too tedious for you, then maybe you want <em>garbage collection</em>, which almost completely eliminates manual memory management &mdash; but garbage collection is way outside the scope of this article.</p>

	<h2>Learn More</h2>

	<p>Wikipedia has a fairly dry and theoretical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting">description of reference counting</a>, which you may want to read.</p>

	<p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/">Cocoa</a>, Mac OS X's set of awesome frameworks, uses reference counting quite a lot. The <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/index.html">Memory Management Guide</a> is mostly oriented at Objective-C, but is a very useful read anyway if you want to know more about reference counting in general.</p>
